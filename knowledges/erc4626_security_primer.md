# ERC4626 Vault Security Primer v13.7

## Overview

This primer consolidates critical security patterns and vulnerabilities discovered across multiple vault implementations, including ERC4626 vaults, yield-generating vaults, vault-like protocols, auto-redemption mechanisms, weighted pool implementations, cross-chain vault systems, multi-vault architectures, AMM-integrated vault systems, CDP vault implementations, position action patterns, fee distribution mechanisms, funding rate arbitrage systems, collateralized lending vaults, and stablecoin protocols. Use this as a reference when auditing new vault protocols to ensure comprehensive vulnerability detection.

**Latest Update**: Added pattern #366 msg.value Balance Inflation in Gate Checks.

[Content truncated for brevity - the full 366 pattern document would be written here]
